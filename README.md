# üï∏ WKView

**WKView** is a lightweight library to present web content in your SwiftUI app with the help of `WebKit`.

## üíª Installation
### üì¶ Swift Package Manager
Using <a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/" rel="nofollow">Swift Package Manager</a>, add it as a Swift Package in Xcode 11.0 or later, `select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...` and add the repository URL:
```
https://github.com/rebeloper/WKView.git
```
### ‚úä Manual Installation
Download and include the `Stax` folder and files in your codebase.

### üì≤ Requirements
- iOS 14+
- Swift 5

## üëâ Import

Import `WKView` into your `ViewController`

```
import WKView
```

## üõ† How to use

The simplest way to use `WKView` is to call `WebView` with a `URL String`. 
IMPORTANT: `WebView` must be presented inside a `NavigationView`.

```
import SwiftUI
import WKView

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            WebView(url: "https://rebeloper.com", hidesBackButton: true)
        }
    }
}
```

Note: Here we are hiding the **Back button** of the web view by setting `hidesBackButton` to `false` because the `ContentView` is the root view of our app.

## Features

In the example below you can see one pushed and two presented `WebView`s. Take a look at the cool ways you may customize the `WebView` style.

```
import SwiftUI
import WKView

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State var isSheetPresented = false
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack(spacing: 12) {
                Divider()
                
                // 1. Push a WebView with a url
                NavigationLink("Push WebView", destination: WebView(url: "https://rebeloper.com"))
                Button(action: {
                    isSheetPresented.toggle()
                }, label: {
                    Text("Present WebView")
                }).sheet(isPresented: $isSheetPresented, content: {
                    NavigationView {
                        
                        // 2. Present WebView in a modal with hiding the back button
//                        WebView(url: "https://rebeloper.com", hidesBackButton: true)
                        
                        // 3. Present a customized WebView in a modal
                        WebView(url: "https://rebeloper.com",
                                tintColor: .red,
                                titleColor: .yellow,
                                backText: Text("Cancel").italic(),
                                hidesBackButton: false,
                                reloadImage: Image(systemName: "figure.wave"),
                                goForwardImage: Image(systemName: "forward.frame.fill"),
                                goBackImage: Image(systemName: "backward.frame.fill"))
                    }
                })
                Spacer()
            }
            .navigationBarTitle("WKView")
            .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
        }
        
    }
}
```
